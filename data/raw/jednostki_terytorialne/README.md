Commuting to work in Poland â€“ results of the National Census of Population and Housing 2011View QR CodeA A Asave as pdfprint
Commuting to work survey in 2011 was conducted based on data contained in administrative registers, acquired by public statistics for the purposes of the National Census of Population and Housing 2011. The methodology of this study is based on earlier work carried out under the project " Survey of employment-related population movements in 2006." This time, the existing data source for this topic (tax records) have been enriched by the resources of other administrators of data. Derived from these sources information significantly increased (compared with 2006) possibility of territorial identification of the main place of work of employees, and commuters among them. Stated above differences in data sources, in spite of all the same methodology used to generate population of commuters, make the results of the survey for 2006. not directly comparable with the results obtained under the National Census of Population and Housing 2011.
